The work is done in collaboration between Ella Xue, Varun Belur, and Jim Li.

Pair.java is created to assist the development of prefix/postfix transformation.
Pair is used to encapsulate operator and the needed number of operands. It is used
in EvaluatePrefixListVisitor.java.

In EvaluatePrefixListVisitor, there is a helper function called eval used to evaluate
the expression on the current stacks based on the operator.
